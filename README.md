# Supply Chain
The Internet Computer (IC) is a decentralized network built using blockchain technology, launched in 2021 by the DFINITY Foundation1. Its primary purpose is to provide a platform capable of hosting fully decentralized applications (DApps) and services while also competing with the low cost and high speed of centralized cloud hosting. To analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the IC, this DApp of a Supply-Chain management tool was created.

## Hardware needed
DFX requires a Unix based system: This project was developed and tested on macOS, both with the intel i7 processor and the M1 Chip.
Should also work on Linux.
## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.
Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```
Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.
